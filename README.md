## Full Stack/Application Developer


#### Game development/modding:

I learned C++ and CMake by writing **[AsteroidsSDL](https://github.com/DaDevFox/AsteroidsSDL2)** (asteroids but you play as the asteroid) in the SDL2 Library. I made the [Elevation](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KCMod_Elevation) mod and an extensible [Reskin Engine](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KC_ReskinEngine) for **[Kingdoms and Castles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/)** among [others](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KCMods).
