## Full Stack/Application Developer


#### Game development/modding:

I learned C++ by writing **[AsteroidsSDL](https://github.com/DaDevFox/AsteroidsSDL2)** (asteroids but you play as the asteroid) with SDL2. I made an educational **[3D rocket-racing](https://github.com/DaDevFox/SpaceRace)** game and a **[trivia](https://github.com/DaDevFox/TriviaGame)** game. I published **[Elevation](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KCMod_Elevation)**, an extensible **[Reskin Engine](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KC_ReskinEngine)**, and [much more](https://github.com/DaDevFox/KCMods) for **[Kingdoms and Castles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/)**.
